## Bug reports and Questions

If you experience any issues - please let us know
[in this dedicated Moralis Forum](https://forum.moralis.io/t/streams-api-beta/19664).

## Roadmap üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

These are features that are not included in this beta but that will be out in
the near future:

- [ ] Including multiple assets or addresses in the same stream
- [ ] Mempool support
- [ ] Automatic retries (browsing failed deliveries and manually retrying is
      possible in beta)

# Your first stream üöÄ

We will be using Moralis SDK to interact with Moralis Streams API.

You can install the Moralis SDK via npm/pnpm/yarn:

```bash
npm install moralis
```

## Example 1 - Monitor a wallet

In this example we will monitor a wallet.

Meaning all incoming and outgoing transactions of that wallet will be monitored!

### Programmatically

We will use Moralis SDK to create a stream.

You can install the Moralis SDK via npm/pnpm/yarn:

```bash
npm install moralis
```

```typescript
import Moralis from "moralis";
import { EvmChain } from "@moralisweb3/evm-utils";

Moralis.start({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

const stream = {
  chains: [EvmChain.ETHEREUM, EvmChain.POLYGON], // list of blockchains to monitor
  description: "monitor Bobs wallet", // your description
  tag: "bob", // give it a tag
  webhookUrl: "https://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL", // webhook url to receive events,
};

const newStream = await Moralis.Streams.add(stream);
const { id } = newStream.toJSON(); // { id: 'YOUR_STREAM_ID', ...newStream }

// Now we attach bobs address to the stream
const address = "0x68b3f12d6e8d85a8d3dbbc15bba9dc5103b888a4";

await Moralis.Streams.addAddress({ address, id });
```

### Via WebUI

1. Go to http://admin.moralis.io/streams
2. Click on `New Stream` button.
3. Fill out the Form:
   - Address: `0x68b3f12d6e8d85a8d3dbbc15bba9dc5103b888a4`
   - Description: `monitor Bobs wallet`
   - Webhook URL: `https://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL`
   - Tag: `bob`
   - Select Blockchain (e.g. Ethereum Mainnet)
4. Click on `Create Stream`

### Monitor multiple addresses

If you want to add multiple addresses to another stream you can always attach
them to an existing stream. 

```typescript
await Moralis.Streams.addAddress({
  id: streamId,
  address: [
    "0xf977814e90da44bfa03b6295a0616a897441acec",
    "0x5754284f345afc66a98fbb0a0afe71e0f007b949",
  ], // Charlies and Douglas address
});
```

#### Attaching multiple addresses to a stream

You can attach millions of addresses to stream. You can remove and get addresses
aswell as adding new ones at any time.

```typescript
// Add addresses
await Moralis.Streams.addAddress({
  id: streamId,
  address: [
    "0xCFDF6Aaae9f6B927E3736FBD327853B622c5060E",
    "0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B",
  ], // Can also be a single string
});

// Delete an address
await Moralis.Streams.deleteAddress({
  id,
  address,
});

// Get all addresses
await Moralis.Streams.getAddresses({ id });
```

## Example 2 - Monitor a smart contract

Now let us monitor a specific event happening on a specific smart contract. In
this example we will monitor all CryptoPunks Transfers.

### Programmatically

```typescript
import Moralis from "moralis";
import { EvmChain } from "@moralisweb3/evm-utils";

Moralis.start({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

const stream = {
  chains: [EvmChain.ETHEREUM], // punks are on ethereum mainnet
  description: "all cryptopunk transfers", // your description
  tag: "cryptoPunks", // give it a tag
  topic0: ["PunkTransfer(address,address,uint256)"], // topic0 is the event signature
  includeContractLogs: true, // we want to include contract logs
  abi: [{
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      { "indexed": true, "name": "from", "type": "address" },
      { "indexed": true, "name": "to", "type": "address" },
      { "indexed": false, "name": "punkIndex", "type": "uint256" },
    ],
    "name": "PunkTransfer",
    "type": "event",
  }],
  webhookUrl: "https://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL", // webhook url to receive events,
};

const newStream = await Moralis.Streams.add(stream);
const { id } = newStream.toJSON(); // id: StreamId

// Now we attach the contract address to the stream
const address = "0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB";

await Moralis.Streams.addAddress({ address, id });
```

### Types

You can get typings for webhooks from the `@moralisweb3/streams` package.

```typescript
import { Types } from "@moralisweb3/streams";
```

### Via WebUI

1. Go to [Streams](http://admin.moralis.io/streams)
2. Click on `New Stream` button.
3. Fill out the Form:
   - Address: `0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB`
   - Webhook URL: `https://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL`
   - Paste in a valid ABI and select the topic
   - Descripition: `all cryptopunk transfers`
   - Tag: `bob`
   - Select Blockchain (e.g. Ethereum Mainnet)
4. Click on `Create Stream`

### Mandatory Test Webhook üö®

Whenever you create or update a stream you will receive a test webhook.

**You have to return status code 200 for the stream to be start.**

The test body will look like this:

```json
{
  "abi": [],
  "block": {
    "hash": "",
    "number": "",
    "timestamp": ""
  },
  "txs": [],
  "txsInternal": [],
  "tag": "",
  "streamId": "",
  "logs": [],
  "chainId": "",
  "confirmed": true,
  "retries": 0,
  "erc20Approvals": [],
  "erc20Transfers": [],
  "nftApprovals": {
    "ERC721": [],
    "ERC1155": []
  },
  "nftTransfers": []
}
```

### Useful Stream Options

#### Include Contract Logs

The `includeContractLogs` option will include all contract logs in the webhook,
should be set to true if you are monitoring a contract. If you are monitoring a
wallet address you can set this to `true` to also get the contract logs if a
wallet interacts with a contract

#### Internal Transactions

You can also monitor all internal transactions happening on chain by setting the
`includeInternalTxs` to `true`.

#### Include Native Transactions

If you are monitoring contract events you can decide to also include the native
transaction details

#### Advanced Options

The Create Stream endpoint also supports advanced options. With this option you
can have more control over the topics you are passing to the stream. For each
topic you can have advanced options that include the `topic`, a
[filter](#filter-streams) and a `includeNativeTxs` field which indicates if you
want to include native transactions.

#### Monitor All Transactions by Topic

Say you have the following topic `Transfer(address,address,uint256)`. You can
get every transfer happening on chain by setting the topic to
`Transfer(address,address,uint256)` and setting `allAddresses` to `true`. That
means you will get all transactions that match this topic.

## We are live! üéâ

Now whenever an ingoing or outgoing transaction involving the address you are
monitoring occurs, you will receive a webhook with the transaction details.

### Two webhooks for each block

You will receive two webhooks for each block that contains the events you are
interested in.

The first webhook will come as soon as the block is mined and have
`confirmed:false`. This means that the block is still running the risk of being
dropped due to a reorganization of the blockchain.

The second webhook will come once enough blocks have been mined after the block
containing your events and have `confirmed:true`. This number of blocks is also
called `number of confirmations`.

[This table](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/streams-beta/blob/main/README.md#supported-chains)
shows the number of confirmations required for Moralis to consider a block
confirmed.

### Edge cases

In rare cases the webhook with `confirmed: true` may come before the one with
`confirmed:false`, please ensure to handle this scenario on your end.

# Webhook Data

## Header

### Verify Webhooks

The Webhook will set a `x-signature` in the header. It is for verifying if the
data you will receive is from Moralis. Essentially it is a hash (sha3) of the
body and your API Key.

You can verify the webhook with the following code:

```typescript
import Moralis from "moralis";

const { headers, body } = request;

Moralis.Streams.verifySignature({
  body,
  signature: headers["x-signature"],
}); // throws error if not valid
```

## Body

The body contains the data you are interested in. Logs is in array containing
raw events and stream information such as tag and the streamId. The body also
contains a chainId, the blocknumber, internal transactions, the abis and a
confirmed field that indicates if the block is confirmed.

### Parsing Smart Contract Events

If you are streaming a smart contract event you can use the code below to
extract the data from the webhook into a typed data structure.

```typescript
// event MyEvent(address indexed from, address indexed to);

interface MyEvent {
  from: string;

```

# Stream Management

## GET Streams

You can see a list of all your streams by calling the following method:

```typescript
const streams = await Moralis.Streams.getAll({
  limit: 100, // limit the number of streams to return
});
```

Or you can see all streams in the [Admin Panel](http://admin.moralis.io/streams)

### Response

```json
{
  "result": [
    {
      "webhookUrl": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "tag": "string",
      "topic0": [],
      "includeNativeTxs": true,
      "allAddresses": false,

      "status": "active",
      "statusMessage": "string"
    }
  ],
  "cursor": "string",
  "total": 1
}
```

## Monitor Stream

Sometimes you want to check if a stream is still active or if something went
wrong. When you [query all your streams](#get-streams) you can see the status of
the stream. There are three possible states: `active`, `paused` and `error`.

## Stream Settings

Moralis sets a default region for your stream. You can change the region
anytime. Choose the region that is closest to your backend for the best
performance.

### Set Settings

#### Programmatically

```typescript
import Moralis from "moralis";

Moralis.start({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

await Moralis.Streams.setSettings({
  region: "eu-central-1", // 'us-east-1' | 'us-west-2' | 'eu-central-1'
});
```

#### Via WebUI

1. Go to [Settings](http://admin.moralis.io/settings)
2. Choose a region which is closest to your backend
3. Click on Save Changes

## Update Stream

In some cases you want to add a chain to an already existing stream or change
the webhook url. Luckily you can easily update your streams.

### Programmatically

Example on how to update the webhook url of a stream:

```typescript
import Moralis from "moralis";

Moralis.start({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

await Moralis.Streams.update({
  id: "STREAM_ID",
  webhook: "https://YOUR_NEW_WEBHOOK_URL",
});
```

## Via WebUI

1. Go to [Streams](http://admin.moralis.io/streams).
2. Hover on the last column of the streams table. You will be able to see more
   options. (Edit, Delete, Pause Stream).
3. Select `Edit` to go to edit form page.
4. Change the things you want to update
5. Click on `Edit Stream`

In some cases you might want to filter the data you receive from the webhook.
You can do this by adding a filter to the stream. Important: You must add a
(valid!) ABI of the event you want to filter! Otherwise the stream will not work

## Example: Monitor Specific NFT Based on Token ID

### Programmatically

```typescript
import { Moralis } from "moralis";
import { EvmChain } from "@moralisweb3/evm-utils";

const options = {
  chains: [EvmChain.ETHEREUM], // list of blockchains to monitor
  description: "monitor one NFT from Collection", // your description
  tag: "mySpecialNft", // give it a tag
  topic0: ["Transfer(address,address,uint256)"], // the event you want to monitor
  includeContractLogs: true,
  abi: [{
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      { "indexed": true, "name": "from", "type": "address" },
      { "indexed": true, "name": "to", "type": "address" },
      { "indexed": false, "name": "tokenId", "type": "uint256" },
    ],
    "name": "Transfer",
    "type": "event",
  }], // valid abi of the event
  advancedOptions: [
    {
      topic0: "Transfer(address,address,uint256)",
      filter: {
        eq: ["tokenId", "1"], // only receive events where tokenId is 1
      },
      includeNativeTxs: true,
    },
  ],
  webhookUrl: "https://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL", // webhook url to receive events,
};

const stream = await Moralis.Streams.add(stream);

// Attach the contract address to the stream
await Moralis.Streams.addAddress({
  id: stream.id,
  address: "0x68b3f12d6e8d85a8d3dbbc15bba9dc5103b888a4", // contract address of the NFT
});
```

# Update/Pause a Stream

You can update the status of a stream at any time. Possible values for status
are `active`, `paused` and `error`.

For example: In some cases you might want to pause a stream. You can do this by
calling the specific endpoint.

## Programmatically

```typescript
await Moralis.Streams.updateStatus({
  id: "YOUR_STREAM_ID",
  status: "paused",
});
```

## Via WebUI

1. Go to [Streams](http://admin.moralis.io/streams).
2. Hover on the last column of the streams table. You will be able to see more
   options. (Edit, Delete, Pause Stream).
3. Select `Pause Stream` to change the status of your stream

## Via HTTP Request

```curl
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://api.moralis-streams.com/streams/evm/STREAM_ID/status' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status": "paused"}'
```

# Error Handling

Moralis guarantees 100% delivery of webhooks. Still you can have errors in your
streams for example if your server is down. Moralis will retry to send the
webhook in intervals. If the webhook is not delivered after 24 hours but you
still want to receive the failed webhooks after some time you can manuallay
[replay](#replay-failed-webhook) the failed webhooks.

## Error State

Your Stream can enter into error state on the following 2 scenarios:

1. Your webhook success-rate is below 70%

2. Your webhook is not consuming the webhooks fast enough so a queue start to build up and reached the limit of 10k queued, 
you can monitor the size of the queue with the header x-queue-size when you receive the webhook, You need to ensure your
server can consume all webhooks fast enough so a queue doesnt build up, moving the streams to a closer region will help
reduce the time.

A stream in Error state will stop sending webhook but will continue saving them in history and the retry schedule will 
resume when the stream is enabled again.

If your Stream enters Error State you will receive a Email notification so you can act before it gets terminated.

## Terminated State

If your Stream stays in Error State for 24 Hours it will be terminated.

A Terminated Stream will not send webhooks and will not process any new blocks, this means the blocks will be dropped.

If your Stream is terminated you will receive a Email notification 

## Retry Intervals

| Retry | Interval |
| ----- | -------- |
| 0     | 1 min    |
| 1     | 10 min   |
| 2     | 1 hour   |
| 3     | 2 hours  |
| 4     | 6 hours  |
| 5     | 12 hours |
| 6     | 1 day    |

## See failed webhooks

The Streams API provides an endpoint to get all failed webhooks. It is useful to
replay the failed webhooks.

While in BETA, all failed webhooks are stored for 48 Hours, once Streams is in production different plans will allow up to 2 weeks retention.

### Programmatically

```typescript
const history = await Moralis.Streams.getHistory({ limit: 100 });
```

### Via WebUI

1. Go to [Failed Deliveries](http://admin.moralis.io/streams/failed). All your
   failed deliveries are listed here.

### Response

The Response is a list of failed webhooks that are uniquely identified by id.
The payload contains the webhook details.

```json

## Replay Failed Webhook

You can replay (retry) a failed webhook by calling the specific endpoint.

### Programmatically

```typescript
await Moralis.Streams.retryWebhook({ id: "HISTORY_ID", streamId: "STREAM_ID" });
```

### Via WebUI

1. Go to [Failed Deliveries](http://admin.moralis.io/streams/failed).
2. Click on the `replay` icon against your failed delivery

## Via Swagger or HTTP

You can use the Swagger UI or make an API call to the endpoint.

```curl
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://api.moralis-streams.com/history/replay/WEBHOOK_ID' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

## Webhook Successrate

Every Stream starts with a successrate of 100% per webhook URL. For every failed
webhook the rate decreases by 1% per webhook URL. For every successful webhook
the rate increases by 1% per webhook URL where the maximum is 100%. If the
success rate is below 70% per webhook URL the stream will be discontinued and an
email is sent to you. The status of your stream will be set to `error`.

If you want to continue receiving events you can
[update the status of a stream](#updatepause-a-stream) to `active`.
